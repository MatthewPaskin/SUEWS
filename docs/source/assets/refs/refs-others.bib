 abstract = {As living organisms, we are most acutely aware of three things about the wind. We know that it exerts a force on us and other objects against which it blows, it is effective in transporting heat from us, and it is highly variable in space and time. A fourth property of the wind, less obvious to the casual observer, but essential to terrestrial life as we know it, is its effective mixing of the atmospheric boundary layer of the earth. This can be illustrated by a simple example. On a hot summer day about 10 kilograms (550 moles) of water can be evaporated into the atmosphere from each square meter of vegetated ground surface. This amount of water would increase the vapor concentration in a 100 m thick air layer by 100 g m$-$3 (136 mmol/mol) if there were no transport out of this layer or condensation within it. This is much more water than the air could hold at normal temperature. The observed increase in vapor concentration in the first 100 meters of the atmosphere is typically less than 1 g m$-$3, so we can see how effective the atmosphere is for transporting and mixing. A similar calculation (Monteith, 1973) shows that photosynthesis in a normally growing crop would use all of the CO2 in a 30 m air layer above a crop in a day, yet measured CO2 concentrations have diurnal fluctuations of 15 percent or less. Without the vertical turbulent transport of heat, water vapor, CO2, oxygen, and other atmospheric constituents, the microenvironment we live in would be very inhospitable.},

Direct measurements of heat and momentum fluxes enabled determination of the Obukhov length {\textless }em{\textgreater }L{\textless }/em{\textgreater }, a key independent variable in the steady-state, horizontally homogeneous, atmospheric surface layer. The free constants in several interpolation formulas can be adjusted to give excellent fits to the wind and temperature gradient data. The behavior of the gradients under neutral conditions is unusual, however, and indicates that von K\'arm\'an's constant is $\sim$0.35, rather than 0.40 as usually assumed, and that the ratio of eddy diffusivities for heat and momentum at neutrality is $\sim$1.35, compared to the often-suggested value of 1.0. The gradient Richardson number, computed from the profiles, and the Obukhov stability parameter {\textless }em{\textgreater }z{\textless }/em{\textgreater }/{\textless }em{\textgreater }L{\textless }/em{\textgreater }, computed from the measured fluxes, are found to be related approximately linearly under unstable conditions. For stable conditions the Richard on number approaches a limit of $\sim$0.21 as stability increases. A comparison between profile-derived and measured fluxes shows good agreement over the entire stability range of the observations.{\textless }/p{\textgreater }{\textless }/section{\textgreater }},

Net radiation (RN) and ground heat flux (G) are directly measured. Sensible heat flux (H) for dry surface conditions is estimated as a residual of the surface energy balance. Throughout the year, ground heat flux is found to be of larger magnitude than that of the sensible heat flux. The partitioning of net radiation into ground and sensible heat fluxes are studied. Variation of G (and H) with RN showed hysteresis loop behaviour with anti-clockwise cycle (clockwise for H) during cooler periods and clockwise cycle (anti-clockwise for H) during warm periods. The coefficients of time-dependent Camuffo and Bernadi formulations relating the net radiation with the heat fluxes are estimated for different periods of the year.},

This variability is expected to be large in urban areas where the surfaces are layered with a variety of man-made materials. Parameterization of the ground heat storage as a function of surface materials is presented based on analyses of data obtained during the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Regional Air Pollution Study conducted in St. Louis, Missouri. Ground heat flux data are derived from observations of surface and subsurface temperatures for a soil layer and for concrete slabs resting on soil. The data show that the presence of the concrete slabs increases the ground storage term relative to that for soil alone. The ground storage and sensible heat flux terms for a blackened concrete slab are larger than for an unpainted concrete slab. For the concrete surfaces, the ratio of ground storage to net radiation is >1 at night and <1 during the day. This ratio is discontinuous at sunrise and sunset transition periods. For soil, the ratio shows similar temporal behavior except that on average, there is a smoother transition at sunrise. Simple mathematical expressions giving the ratio of ground heat storage to net radiation as a function of time are presented.}},

This flux is difficult to measure but one approach is to parameterize it using relations between the net all-wave radiation and the heat flux conducted into and out of the typical materials that form the surface of cities and combine them into a weighted average to give the bulk storage. Urban heat storage parameterization could be improved if there were more and better estimates of the net radiation vs. storage relation for typical urban and suburban roofs. This paper presents the results of a study of the heat storage characteristics of 6 different roof assemblies (typical of many North American commercial/industrial and residential buildings) in Vancouver, Canada, observed across a range of wind and moisture conditions. Further, these observations are used to verify the Simplified Transient Analysis of Roofs (STAR) model, which is then used to estimate the heat storage parameterization for other roof types, thereby extending the usefulness of the scheme to a wider range of urban areas.}},

The energy balance of the urban canyon is represented by the balance at the imaginary surface named ``the top surface''. The top surface is a plane above the canyon at the same level as the roof surface of the buildings. In the daytime, the energy budget into the top surface is much larger than that into the roof surface. At nighttime, there is no significant difference in the energy balance between the roof surface and the top surface.}},

The soil moisture content has little effect on this fraction but modifies the phase relationship between the net radiation and the soil heat flux density waves. Differences between the thermal regimes of the `wet' and `dry' soil appear to be caused by latent heat exchanges rather than changes of the soil thermal properties. The data also show that the variation with depth of the soil thermal properties strongly influences the propagation of the temperature and heat flux density waves in the soil. A heat diffusion theory for non-homogeneous conductors (Lettau, 1962) which enables the thermal properties of the soil to be predicted is tested by comparison with experimental determinations in the field.}},

This paper reports the first extended set of winter-spring-time energy balance measurements for a city. The study was conducted in a suburb of Vancouver, British Columbia, from January to June 1987. It included hourly measurements of net all-wave radiation, sensible heat flux and the Bowen ratio. The anthropogenic and storage heat fluxes were modelled. A dynamic source area model was employed to ensure the modelled parameters were consistent spatially with the measured turbulent fluxes. The winter-spring urban energy balances observed in this study are different to those reported for summertime conditions at the same site. The fluxes for the entire period are not symmetrical about solar noon. Hence earlier interpretations possibly should be modified. Apart from this feature the spring season balances are similar to those reported for the summertime in terms of relative importance of individual fluxes. The wintertime energy balance appears to be different to that of spring and summer. The most noticeable feature is the increased importance of the latent heat flux, which on average is the largest output flux in the balance. A secondary, more expected feature, is the increased importance of anthropogenic heat flux as an input in winter.}},
